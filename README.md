    <h1>Autonomous Floor Cleaning Robot 🧹🤖</h1>
    <p>An innovative robot that detects obstacles and cleans automatically!</p>
  </header>

  <section id="intro">
    <h2>Project Overview</h2>
    <p>Our Autonomous Floor Cleaning Robot is designed to make cleaning effortless. It automatically detects objects in its path and changes direction to continue its cleaning process. In addition, it can spray water to clean surfaces and even clean itself!</p>

  <section id="features">
    <h2>🔧 Key Features</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>🛑 Automatic Obstacle Detection & Direction Change</li>
      <li>💧 Water Dispensing for Efficient Cleaning</li>
      <li>🧼 Self-Cleaning Mechanism</li>
      <li>📱 Remote Control for Manual Override</li>
      <li>🔋 Long Battery Life</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section id="hardware">
    <h2>🖥️ Hardware Components</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>🧠 Microcontroller (Arduino or Raspberry Pi)</li>
      <li>🔊 Ultrasonic Sensors (for obstacle detection)</li>
      <li>⚡ Motors (for movement control)</li>
      <li>💧 Water Dispensing Mechanism</li>
      <li>🧹 Brushes and Cleaning Pads</li>
      <li>🔋 Rechargeable Battery</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section id="operation">
    <h2>⚙️ How it Works</h2>
    <p>The robot uses ultrasonic sensors to detect objects in its path. When an obstacle is detected, the robot will automatically change direction to avoid the object and continue cleaning. It can also release water to clean surfaces, and once done, it will return to its charging station and start the self-cleaning process.</p>
